### Simple Salary Calculator using C++

The application will compute the employee salary for regular weekly pay and overtime pay if applies. The program will prompt the user to enter the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. The regular working hours are limited to 40. If there are more hours worked than 40 the overtime rate will apply for those hours that is 50% more than regular hourly rate. 

The formula to calculate is: 

    Regular Salary: hourly rate * regular hours
    Overtime Salary: Additional Hours * (1.5 * hourly rate)
    Overall Salary: Regular Salary + Overtime Salary
